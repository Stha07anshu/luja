      'World within world is a studio project based on the reading of Donna Harawayâ€™s "Staying with the Trouble." Haraway states that the world we currently reside in is a mess, and finding a simple solution will not address the change. Social injustice and social crises exist within a society, and instead of looking for a solution, Donna encourages us to confront and work with the trouble and complexity. She encourages us to see ourselves as part of intricate webs of relationships and to work within these complex systems. Her text also emphasizes the concept of co-existence and the symbiotic relationship between humans and the "earth other." Her concept of inclusion of other beings gives a broader view of justice that includes the rights and well-being of non-human species. Based on her reading, the project is developed not to solve the injustice that is going on in society or between the two co-existing beings. Instead, the project is designed to create a different world where species collaboration and coexistence are equally celebrated.',
      'It aims to represent the interaction between multiple dimensions within a unified space. The design concept embodies this interaction through the careful layering of spaces, integrating light and materials in such a way that they reflect the duality of being both part of a greater whole and independent in their form. The project challenges traditional boundaries by embracing open-ended spatial relationships and emphasizing freedom of movement.',
      'The design intends to invoke a sense of introspection and contemplation through the subtle interplay of material, form, and light. By merging the organic and the synthetic, the project aims to create a space where the user can explore both the physical and emotional aspects of their existence.'
